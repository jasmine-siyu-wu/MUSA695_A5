### Audience identification
The target audience of this narrative is **state licensing agencies (Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV), Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or Motor Vehicle Division (MVD))**.
They are responsible for issuing driver's licenses, learner's permits, and other driving credentials. This includes conducting written and practical driving tests to assess applicants' knowledge of traffic laws and their driving skills. Some BMVs are involved in promoting driver education and safety programs, such as defensive driving courses and programs for young or inexperienced drivers. Therefore, such agencies have a vested interest in teenage drivers' access to driver education and licensing for several important reasons:
- **Safety on the Road**: Young, inexperienced drivers are at a higher risk of accidents and traffic violations. Proper driver education can help reduce these risks by teaching teenagers the necessary skills and knowledge to become safer drivers. When teenagers receive quality driver education, they are more likely to develop good driving habits and make safer decisions behind the wheel.  
- **Reduced Accident Rates**: Access to driver education and training programs has been associated with lower accident rates among teenage drivers. This means fewer accidents on the road, which can help reduce the societal costs associated with traffic accidents, including medical expenses, property damage, and emergency services.
- **Compliance with Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Laws**: Many states implement Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) programs, which phase in driving privileges for teenagers. Driver education is often a requirement for obtaining an intermediate or full driver's license under GDL systems. BMVs have a role in enforcing these laws and ensuring that teenage drivers meet the educational requirements.
- **Improved Knowledge of Traffic Laws**: Driver education courses typically cover state-specific traffic laws and regulations. When teenagers complete these courses, they are more likely to be aware of and comply with the rules of the road, reducing the likelihood of traffic violations.
- **Better Preparedness for Real-World Driving**: Driver education programs not only teach basic driving skills but also provide guidance on handling challenging situations, such as inclement weather, emergency maneuvers, and interactions with other drivers. This prepares teenage drivers to be more confident and capable on the road.
- **Lower Insurance Costs**: Insurance companies often offer discounts to drivers who have completed driver education programs. Lower insurance costs can make driving more affordable for teenagers and their families.
- **Positive Public Image**: BMVs are responsible for promoting safe and responsible driving in their communities. Supporting and encouraging driver education programs for teenagers helps build a positive public image for the agency and demonstrates a commitment to road safety.
- **Reduction in Unlicensed Driving**: Access to driver education and licensing programs can reduce the incidence of unlicensed or unauthorized teenage drivers. Unlicensed driving can lead to legal issues and potentially dangerous situations on the road.
- **Prevention of High-Risk Behaviors**: Quality driver education programs often include education on the dangers of high-risk behaviors like distracted driving, speeding, and driving under the influence. Teaching teenagers about these risks can help deter them from engaging in such behaviors.
- **Community and Family Well-Being**: Safer teenage drivers contribute to the well-being of their families and communities. Reducing accidents and injuries among young drivers helps ensure that families and communities do not have to deal with these events' emotional and financial consequences.

### Decisions in narrative crafting
This data story aims to stress the disparities of access to driver education and young driver licensure observed in Ohio may exist in other states â€“ the data is not always available for research, so we call for in-depth investigation by BMV agencies and research institutions. The details of the methodology of statistical analyses and modeling are not crucial for officials to understand the motive. Therefore, this data story presents the analysis results in well-designed visual formats. Clear and engaging interpretations accompany all visuals. That is, the story is the priority of this data story, and data is supplementary. To achieve these goals, I made the following decisions in narrative crafting:
1. I structured this narrative to start with the punchline, highlighting the target audience, the issue, the main conclusion, and the actions that I call for. The introduction is followed by evidence from a series of profound studies and concludes with a detailed call to action.
2. This narrative combines statistical data with real-life examples (unreal characters :), adding a human element to the story. The personal stories help to personalize the issue, making it more engaging and emotionally resonant for readers, making the comprehensive data more relatable and impactful.
3. I reference specific studies (the ones I co-authored or am familiar with) and provide concrete data points (like the 25% lower likelihood of driver training in DTDs) that lend credibility and weight to the narrative. I also selectively skip the statistical analysis and modeling details to tailor the data story for government officials rather than technical experts.
4. I focus the second half of the narrative on policy implications and recommendations. Most of the recommendations are practical and rather relevant to the evidence shown in the narrative's first half: calling for actions of state BMVs to conduct comprehensive data collection, identify and address disparities, implement targeted policy interventions, promote equitable access, and monitor policies.
